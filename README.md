# bibtex-js 

Library for parsing BibTeX .bib files ðŸ“š. 

This module literally just parses a BibTex file and doesn't do any TeX string processing (i.e., `{\"o}` is not translated to `Ã¶`). If you want to actually work with a bibliography, look for [Bibliography.js](https://github.com/digitalheir/bibliography-js).

Also, many internal BibTeX functions are not implemented yet, simply because I don't need them personally. Pull requests are welcome.
